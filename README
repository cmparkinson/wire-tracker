Wiring Tracker

This project was an excuse to play around with SmartGWT, Spring 3 and the
JPA 2 reference implementation (EclipseLink).  The GUI is incomplete, however
the server-side components are functional.

The application consists of a GWT-based web client that communicates with a
RESTful Spring Web MVC server.  Persistence is handled via the JPA 2 interface
and uses EclipseLink to map the domain objects to MySQL.

The server is designed to run in Tomcat, but should work in any servlet
container.
